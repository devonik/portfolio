## My journey

Recently, I started to build my new REST API within a Docker container. Now I want to deploy the container so I can use it in my production app. \
\
My used Docker image needs at least 4 GB RAM, and my current VPS (hosted on Namecheap) has only 2 GB. Since my project is just experimental for now, I was looking for an affordable and simple solution.

## Solution

Then I found **Railway**\
I deployed my container within 5 minutes (or less), and it worked perfectly. I even have a clean overview of used resources and real-time logging. The hobby plan with 8GB RAM and more costs me $5/month, and it is cheaper than the alternatives.
