  Hello 👋 I'm a Senior Full Stack Developer since 01/2018 with a passion to improve User- and Developer experiences, solve problems and always improving oneself 📚
  
  ### My Philosophy

  My philosophy is rooted in **understanding**, **analyzing** and **problem-solving**. I believe great development starts with understanding the 'why' – the user's needs, motivations, and pain points. I use research, iterative prototyping (often with tools like Figma), and user testing to ensure the solutions I build are truly effective.
  <br><br>
  I strive to create **clean, maintainable code** that not only meets current requirements but is also adaptable for future needs. I follow best practices and design patterns to ensure scalability and performance.

  ### What Drives Me

  What keeps me excited about this work is the constant learning and the challenge of translating complex ideas into simple, elegant solutions. There's nothing more rewarding than seeing a idea to life and knowing it's making someone's digital interaction easier or more enjoyable.

  ### Beyond the Screen

  If I'm not in front of my laptop, I'm most likely travelling 🗺️⁀જ✈︎, scuba diving 🤿 or in a table tennis club 🏓
