title: React Native Developer
description: Pong master is an App for the Outdoor Table tennis Community in Germany. This App is written in React Native, and I am supporting as a React Native developer. I redesigned the parts of the app and transferred Figma designs into the app. I redesigned the log in screen by implementing a background video, I redesigned the user review screen and I implemented new search functions for the map.
