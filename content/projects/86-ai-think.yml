title: Senior Full Stack Developer
description: 
  I am supporting AI Think with their project as a Senior full-stack developer. 
  Their main product is the AI-VI Studio to let companies create their own AI video bots quickly and without heavy tech overhead.
  My tasks include maintenance of the frontend and backend as well as new feature development. I built the plugin that can be used by the user to implement the AI Avatar Chat in any website, including WordPress.
  Used technologies are Vue3, TailwindCSS, SignalIO, NodeJs (NestJs), and GitLab.
