title: Senior Full Stack Developer
description: I supported L1R1 with their project for 3 months as a Senior Full Stack Developer. The Product offers the User an option to upload any kind of invoice. The Invoice will be scanned via OpenAI and fields were automatically detected. After some calculations, the User can upload the cleaned Invoice into a financial software as Billomat or InvoiceNinja. I used Vue3, Nuxt3 and NodeJs. I optimized some team processes as the branching strategy and I implemented a ESLint Config for better collaboration
