title: Yogagraphy generator for Christmas cards
description: In this Project, the agency made yogagraphy's from people for every A-Z character. We sent Christmas cards to every agency's customer with an automated email campaign through Mailchimp. I built an REST API with Laravel to generate the Christmas card with the customer name (generated from yogagraphy pictures). The email template will be uploaded to Mailchimp so that it can be sent to the customers on Christmas day.
