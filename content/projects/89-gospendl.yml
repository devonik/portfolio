title: Website for price comparison within the bitcoin community
description: 
  This website shows diverse products that can be paid for with Bitcoin, offers Bitcoin discounts, or offers cashback in the form of bitcoins. 
  As a search index, I am using Algolia, and the data is coming from 1,000+ different websites that include e-commerce, domain providers, E-SIM providers, and more.
  I implemented Crawl4AI as a crawler since it offers the best flexibility for my case - read more about it in my Blog "Exploring AI-Driven Web Crawling - A Beginner’s Journey".
  I created this website using Nuxt 4, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Crawl4AI (Docker), and Algolia.
