      questions:
        - label: How much does a project typically cost?
          content: |
            Project costs vary based on scope, complexity, features, and timeline. For comprehensive projects, my engagements typically start around $5,000, with average projects ranging between $8,000 and $25,000. For consulting or specific tasks, my day rate is $700.

            I generally require a 40% deposit to schedule the project and begin work, with the remaining 60% due upon successful project completion and delivery. I accept payments via bank transfer and Stripe.
        - label: How long does a typical project take?
          content: |
            Timelines depend heavily on the project's scope and complexity. Smaller projects might take 3-4 weeks, while larger, more involved projects can range from 2 to 4 months. I always provide a detailed timeline estimate after the initial discovery phase.

          content: |
            Yes, for clients needing ongoing design support, feature development, or maintenance, I offer monthly retainer options tailored to specific needs. Let's discuss if this is something you're interested in.

            I love the challenge of solving complex problems through design and technology.

Bridging the gap between user needs and technical possibilities is what truly excites me.

            When I'm not designing or coding, I enjoy traveling the world, explore new cultures and scuba diving in the ocean. I'm also passionate about tabletennis and occasionally contribute to open-source projects.
